     My name is Josh Linck. I am a Junior at Mizzou majoring in Information Technology. I plan to have a career in cyber security. I am originally from the Chicagoland area and currently live there. I enjoy spending time outdoors and with my pets. I have a cat and a dog. I have some experience with html. In 2830 I learned basic html with css and php. I am excited to learn more about html and css without focusing so much on scripting. I took this class to gain a better understanding of the language behind websites. I think it is useful information to know, since I interact with websites a lot in my daily life. The previous class I took on these topics focused mostly on using scripts on basic html websites to create functionality. I am excited to gain more advanced knowledge of html and css without focusing on the scripting.
