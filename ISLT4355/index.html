        <h2>Welcome:</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to the website! This website will teach you the basics of the coding language python 
            and how to get started creating your first program. This is a beginner level tutorial for those with little to 
            no experience with python, however, you should have basic knowledge of a computer. This includes 
            being able to navigate a browser and download files. First you will learn what python is and what it is 
            used for. Then you will learn how to download and install python, open the standard python 
            development environment, and create your first blank program. Finally, you will learn your first line of 
            code in python along with how to save and run your program. You will also have the opportunity to 
            learn about some basic functions and operations that are commonly used in python. You can visit the 
            Educator Credentials page to learn more about me or go straight to the Letâ€™s Learn page and start 
            learning about python. Happy coding! </p>
