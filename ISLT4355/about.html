        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Josh Linck. I first gained an interest in computer science and information technology in high 
            school when I took a computer science course that was offered. I enjoyed what I learned about the 
            subject and chose to continue my education focusing on these topics. I chose to continue my studies at 
            the University of Missouri Columbia. I am currently a junior studying Information Technology and 
            planning to specialize in cyber security. I plan on finishing my degree in the spring of 2024. I have 
            experience with many different programming languages including Python, C, html, JavaScript, and 
            scripting with PHP. I also have fundamental knowledge of Networking, media design, user experience, 
            and cyber security. Once I graduate, I plan to have a career in Cyber Security as well as continue to 
            improve my skills and knowledge in other areas of the information technology field. A quote I enjoy is 
        </p><blockquote>"The purpose of our lives is to be happy" by the Dalai Lama.</blockquote>
